OpenTok-meteor
==============

a meteor smart package for meteor

This Package encapsulates

  + [The official opentok clientside library](http://www.tokbox.com/opentok/webrtc/docs/js/tutorials/helloworld.html)
  + [the official opentok-node module](https://github.com/opentok/opentok-node/blob/master/package.json)



On the server side, the global OpenTok is exposted which you can use
throughout the server side.

On the client side, the *TB* global is exposed allowing access to all
client side functions. To add convenience, I also created an alias for
OpenTok that equalis TB so be aware that they are different though
related things depending on wether the code is on the client or server
